              <p>The puppies have all doubled their birth weights and have opened their eyes.  Most are taking several steps and then resorting to scooching to get around the whelping box to find mama, investigate or locate their next napping spot.</p>

              <p>These past few weeks we have been engaging the puppies in <a href="https://breedingbetterdogs.com/article/early-neurological-stimulation" target=blank>early neurological stimulation</a>.  A series of brief “exercises” that are thought to stimulate the puppies already innate natural abilities.  Some of them don’t mind at all, but others wriggle their way through the last few exercises voicing their objections!  We have discovered a few puppies practicing their bark.  Despite their protests, the benefits for doing these neural stimulations are lifelong and include:</p>

              <p>Happy Valentine’s Day!  These cuties are the sweetest Valentine’s my family could ask for.  We have a new puppy pile photo for you.  The puppies are all gaining weight nicely, we weigh (and snuggle) them daily and chart their progress.  They should double their birth weight in 8-10 days.  They have started wriggling their tails while nursing which is something our children remember fondly from our last litter, it’s really cute.  The next milestones are eyes opening (about 12 days) and walking (1-2 wks).</p>

            <p>We are happy to announce Montana’s 2021 litter! Montana whelped 6 puppies on Mon. and into Tues. (Feb. 8 and 9, 2021).</p>
            <p>There are 3 boys and 3 girls. See the litter names and collar color below.  Most of the puppies are sable and white. A few of these are a darker sable and white than the puppies in Montana’s 2018 litter were at birth.  Only one (female) is tri-colored with some brown coloring similar to what we remember <a href="maria.html">Maria</a> and <a href="marta.html">Marta</a> looking like in the 2018 litter.</p>
            <p>Our vet stopped by on her way home on Tuesday and did a health check on everyone. Mama and pups are all doing well. We are getting to know all of them with our children frequently checking in on them day and night- “No, you don’t need to go say ‘goodnight’ to the puppies again.” The puppies enjoyed their first snuggles from friends today and Montana managed to get a few moments to herself and enjoy stretching her legs on unseasonable, 62 degree day.</p>
            <ul>Females
              <br>
              <li>Lily has a pink collar</li>
              <li>Iris has light purple</li>

            <p><img class="img-thumbnail fixed-gallery float-right" src="images/montana_and_wallace2.jpg" alt="Montana and Wallace" width=500>In December of 2020, Montana was bred to Glen Craigean's Dunrovin Cormac (call name Wallace) again. We have had such great feedback from owners of the 2018 litter, we decided to pair Monatana and Wallace for a second and final time. These links have more information about <a href="wallace.html">Wallace</a> , his <a href="wallace.html#genetics">genetics</a> and some <a href="wallace.html#photos">photos</a>.
            <br><br>
            We are excited for the pairing of Montana and Wallace.  This line is unrelated to many OTSC’s currently being bred.  This match brings new genes into the OTSC gene pool which is necessary to help keep up the preservation of these fabulous dogs. Both of these dogs are working farm dogs who either live with or have been exposed frequently to various types of livestock and farm animals.  They are both excellent at pest control. Wallace’s favorite past time is catching squirrels and rats.  Montana is savvy enough to cut woodchucks off from their burrow and chase them into the nearest tree. Both dog's are excellent guardians to their young human family members as well as their animal charges. This is what owners of the puppies from the 2018 litter have to say:

              "He's amazing and if you bred those two again we'd want another."  "He's a homebody not super outgoing or into new situations with lots of unfamiliar factors.  But has never shown anything other than barking in those times.  That's the only thing I could actually sort of frame negatively.  He does fine at friends houses, vet, etc.  Not a park dog.  Great with all people and kids coming here.  Barks/alerts with strangers and backs off when we give ok.  He has an awesome fierce bark!"

              “We were graced with a puppy from this pairing last year (Montana x Wallace 2018), and couldn’t be happier with our dog.  We have a close relationship with another dog from that litter and she is incredible as well.  I highly recommend this combination of fantastic dogs!”

            <p>
              “We think he is great!  He has a blast with all the kids and still exhibits herding instincts. I think Wallace and Montana were a great pairing."
