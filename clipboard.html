            <p>Montana whelped 8 healthy puppies in the wee hours of July 16th!  We are very pleased to have 6 females and 2 males.  There were no complications with her first whelping and she is an attentive mother.</p>

            <p>Check back in a few days for more pictures and details about these darling little pups!</p>

            <h4>A little about their care...</h4>
            <p>Our puppies will be handled from birth with our family and friends to start their socialization, and to help us evaluate them. All puppies are introduced to basic training at 4 weeks old, using positive reinforcement. From six to eight weeks of age they are crate trained, keenly observed for temperament, and evaluated before sending them to their new homes.</p>

            <h4>About the puppies' sire...</h4>
            <p>In May of 2018, Montana was bred to Glen Craigean's Dunrovin Cormac or Wallace as he is more affectionately known.</p>
            <p>Wallace is a milk sable, working old time Scotch Collie who is protective of young livestock and who can catch individual chickens without harm and on command. He guards unfenced goats and can put errant goats back in their pasture. He catches farm pests like squirrels and rats. Wallace is loving and protective of his 3 human children charges and is an able swimmer. See Wallace's <a href="wallace.html#genetics">genetics</a> and <a href="wallace.html#photos">photos</a>.</p>
