            <p>Montana whelped 8 beautiful, healthy puppies in the wee hours of July 16th!  We are very pleased to have 6 females and 2 males.  There were no complications with her first whelping and she is an attentive mother.</p>

            <h4>A little about their care...</h4>
            <p>Our puppies will be handled from birth with our family and friends to start their socialization, and to help us evaluate them. All puppies are introduced to basic training at 4 weeks old, using positive reinforcement. From six to eight weeks of age they are crate trained, keenly observed for temperament, and evaluated before sending them to their new homes.</p>

            <p><img class="img-thumbnail fixed-gallery float-right" src="images/montana_and_wallace2.jpg" alt="Montana and Wallace" width=500>In May of 2018, Montana was bred to Glen Craigean's Dunrovin Cormac or Wallace as he is more affectionately known. Here is more information about <a href="wallace.html">Wallace</a> , his <a href="wallace.html#genetics">genetics</a> and <a href="wallace.html#photos">photos</a>.
            <br><br>
            We are excited for the pairing of Montana and Wallace.  This new line is unrelated to many OTSC’s currently being bred.  This match brings new genes into the OTSC gene pool which is necessary to help keep up the preservation of these fabulous dogs. Both of these dogs are working farm dogs who either live with or have been exposed frequently to various types of livestock and farm animals.  They are both excellent at pest control. Wallace’s favorite past time is catching squirrels and rats.  Montana is savvy enough to cut woodchucks off from their burrow and chase them into the nearest tree. Both dog's are excellent guardians to their young human family members.

Some of the new foods they are trying are cottage cheese, yogurt, and broth or milk soaked kibble. They LOVE it and eat it right up. Of course, they are still nursing and getting snuggles from mama Montana as well. 
            <br>
            Now that the pups are walking, we put them outside any time it's not raining. There is lots to explore; new textures, sights and smells to investigate. There is also plenty of room for rough housing or to find a quite corner away from the din for a nap.</p>

          <p>Hello to all mamas out there. Do you remember those early days with your first born?  And do you remember the moments you could sip some tea with a fellow mama who knew what you were going through?  Well, I'll personify here and say Montana got some mama time with one of our hens who is raising a few little ones of her own.  I'm not sure if the hen understood Montana's perspective of nursing 8 puppies with bottomless bellies, but they got along well.  Though they've been fenced more lately than they are used to, both agreed on it's value for keeping their wee ones safe.  I imagine both of them dreaming of the days when they can roam "wild" and free again.</p>

We lost all but one nectarine off our tree a few nights ago.  And this morning I came out to see a deer starting in on the apples. We are very pleased Montana is so focused on being a great mother. At the same time, we’d like our varmint control back!</p>

Since we both homeschool our children, they have all witnessed the courtship, breeding and now fruition of that.  Today they get to share in the joy of seeing and cuddling these sweet pups.
            <br>
            <br>
            The puppies are all gaining weight and scootching around a bit more.  I'm amazed to see some personalities already developing and wonder if we will continue to see these same characteristics throughout the coming weeks.</p>

She is patient and kind with them while nudging them into place next to her and cleaning their bums.  She takes breaks for herself whenever my children and I come for a "puppy visit".  She will stretch her legs or just go sit in the sun for a bit.  She's getting plenty of food and water to keep up the milk supply.  She went on her first real walk today leaving the puppies under the care of my daughter but was eager to get back to them once she heard some of them calling for her.  I didn't doubt she would be a good mother considering how gentle she is with all the children that come to our house to play but I suppose you never know for sure until you see it.</p>
